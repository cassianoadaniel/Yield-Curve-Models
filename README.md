# Yield-Curve-Models
$\bullet$ Yield Curve Models and Stochastic Interest Rates with US Department of the Treasury Data
- Nelson-Siegel, Nelson-Siegel-Svensson, and cubic spline to determine missing data in US treasury rates 
- Utilized the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross stochastic models to forecast future yield curves 
- Applied maximum likelihood estimation and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate predictions against current data
