1. Nelson-Siegel, Nelson-Siegel-Svensson, and cubic spline to determine missing data in US treasury rates 
2. Utilized the Vasicek and Cox-Ingersoll-Ross stochastic models to forecast future yield curves 
3. Applied maximum likelihood estimation and Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate predictions against current data
